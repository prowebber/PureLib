# PureLib

## Overview
PureLib is a lightweight and simple JavaScript library created to replace the usage of jQuery across web 
applications.  PureLib only contains commonly used JavaScript actions and does not support outdated/uncommon browsers.
This significantly reduces file size and load time.
